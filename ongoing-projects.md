# Fixing the repeater
Currently, the W8YX repeater is without a PL tone because the custom circuit board on the back of the repeater controller died. The current plan with this is to go up to the roof of Calhoun and investigate how the repeater controller connects to the repeater unit, and see if we can replace it with a more modern piece of technology like a raspberry pi or arduino that would be more accessable for things like changing the messages, PL tone, etc.
