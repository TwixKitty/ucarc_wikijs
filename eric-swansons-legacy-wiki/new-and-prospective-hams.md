## Testing locations

# Cheap handheld dual band radios
* [PoFung UV-5R (amazon)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007H4VT7A) - $36 on Jul 21, 2014
* [PoFung UV-B5 (amazon)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BXVOKTW) - $34 on Jul 21, 2014

These are both tremendous value radios. The UV-B5 is rumoured to have a better receiver, and obviously has a rotary encoder for tuning on the top. The UV-B6 is the same radio as the UV-B5, but with a flashlight instead of the rotary encoder.

## Must-have accessories for either handheld
* Programming cable - you can pick these up for <$10 at time of writing. I can't recommend a good one available for purchase now, as I've had mine forever. Someone please edit and insert a reasonable Amazon or eBay link.
* [Speaker-mike (amazon)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008RZ0EQ0) - okay, this isn't a "must have" but I find it makes a handheld far more usable. It also has a headphone jack which can really make listening to weak signals easier (rare on FM, though).
