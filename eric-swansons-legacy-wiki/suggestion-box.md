This is a list of things we find interesting and want to try to accomplish over this next year. We are mostly looking for people who share these interests, as we don't particularly like working alone! Feel free to add to this list or chop it up. Maybe put your name or call next to your idea, or by one of the existing ones if you're interested.

* Fix the Sat antenna! (ND8D)
    * Repair / rebuilt the VHF Yagi (Done, ND8D)
    * Replace the boom,  preferably some way that the elevation rotor won't just destroy again (done, ND8D)
    * Optional (but awesome): build an Arduino bridge to the motor controller in the shack to allow computer control of the rotors, and implement some software to use gpredict or other tracking FOSS to drive it.

* Get a 20m/40m dipole up (ND8D)
    * Run from the elevator house to the mounting point of the current DXCC
    * Or maybe reuse the DXCC? Of course, this is predicated on the idea that it's being massively detuned by the copper flashing, not just that it sucks.
    * Or build a good Off Center Fed Dipole for 40-10 (ND8D)

* Build an Arduino Mega Bluetooth-TNC for use with a UV-5R/UV-B5 and APRSDroid (WI3G)
    * [Existing work](https://sites.google.com/site/ki4mcw/Home/arduino-tnc)
    * Maybe have a configuration with a GPS module and no Bluetooth for a self-contained TrackBox

* Get a 30m dipole up and WSPRnet (ND8D)
    * [WSPRnet](http://wsprnet.org/drupal/) is a weak-signals mode, superficially similar to JT65.
    * Most WSPRnet action takes place on 30m
    * [Some people](https://github.com/threeme3/WsprryPi) have run this from a RaspberryPi. I have one to donate if someone is interested in working on this project with me.

* Get an APRS digipeater up and running on Calhoun (ND8D)
    * Fairly low priority for me, but would be nifty.
    * Would require serious consideration regarding filtering.

* Balloon Project
