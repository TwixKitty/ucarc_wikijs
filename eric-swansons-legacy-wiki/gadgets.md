Here are cool gadgets I (Eric Swanson WI3G) have found and routinely use and/or carry. These are all either excellent or a good value for the money.

# Knives
Nobody's everyday carry is complete without a folding locking knife.
* [Benchmade Griptilian](http://www.rei.com/product/787255/benchmade-551-griptilian-knife) ($92) - I got this off eBay and have tried another half-dozen knives, but I keep coming back to this one.
* [CRKT M16-01Z](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000YD6GQU) ($27) - Why have one knife when you can have two? This is a lot cheaper and less threatening looking than the Griptilian. I carry one as a loaner knife.
* [Mora Companion](http://www.ebay.com/itm/230980414700) ($12) - This is a fixed blade, and a nice tool to keep in your car.

# Flashlights
The second part of any well rounded EDC is a nice flashlight.
* [Fenix PD30](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001H4MWA4) ($58) - This light uses 2xCR123 photo batteries. They can be hard to find, but it's very bright and they last a decently long time. I bought [these](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001W9Y4PK) with the flashlight and still have more than half of them left two years later.
* [UltraFire 7W Cree](http://www.ebay.com/itm/370884021036) ($5 shipped!) - This light is tiny, bright, and uses 1xAA battery. It has far fewer features than the Fenix, and makes an uglier light (you can see the LED pattern), but it's quite nice for $5! This is the third version I've seen under the same name, and far from the nicest, but it's cheap and works.

# Other Gadgets
* [Gerber multi-tool](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EDPT9K) ($15) - Nice cheap multitool. Never know when you'll need pliers.
* [Kill-a-watt](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009MDBU) ($18) - Useful for finding the power usage of 120V things.
* [Casio F91W](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAWSDG) ($10) - Awesome digital watch with all the bells and whistles for really cheap. There is also a [metal-banded version](http://www.amazon.com/Casio-A158W-1-Classic-Stainless-Bracelet/dp/B000GAYQJ0) ($12) if you want to dress it up.
* [Logitech M325](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DSPLDA) ($20) - Nice "laptop-bag" mouse for when you hate trackpads.
* [Jeweler's Loupe](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T4OWZ0) ($5) - Great for looking at tiny circuits or writing.
* [Neiko Digital Calipers](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GSLKIW) ($17) - Not sure if these are lab quality, but great for everyday calipering needs.
* [USB Sound Card](http://www.ebay.com/itm/400460458738) ($4 shipped!) - This is a cheap and decent USB sound card to add a second audio interface to your laptop, desktop, Raspberry Pi, whatever.
