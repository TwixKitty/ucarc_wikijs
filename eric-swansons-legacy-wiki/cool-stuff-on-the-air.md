# Oddities and Numbers Stations 
* [UVB-76](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UVB-76) "The Buzzer" 4625kHz - a Russian station hypothesized to be part of a dead man switch to launch all nukes if Moscow was destroyed. 

# WebSDR
* [WebSDR at University of Twente, NL](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/) - anyone with Java or HTML5 support in their browser can tune in to the entire HF band as heard from the University of Twente in the Netherlands. This is a great way to do some shortwave listening, as well as hear things from the "oddities" section
