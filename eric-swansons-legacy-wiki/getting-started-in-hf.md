## Introduction

So you want to do some HF, huh? Well, first, I suggest visiting the UC Amateur Radio Club and using the UCARC station. At time of writing, W8YX operates using a TenTec Omni VI with a 500W solid state amplifier and autotuner. This is all feeding an Alpha Delta DX-CC fan-dipole antenna radiating east-west on the roof of the Old Chemistry building.

## Bands and Modes

Check out the [band plan](http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Regulatory/Band%20Chart/Hambands_color.pdf). If you're only going to have one band, you'd probably want to pick between 20m and 40m. While interesting conversations can happen on all the bands, 20m and 40m are open at least part of the day almost every day. 20m is typically considered a daytime band, while 40m is typically considered a nighttime band.

In general, you'll want to use USB (upper side band) on bands 20m and above (20m, 15m, 10m, ...) and LSB (lower side band) on bands 40m and below (40m, 80m, ...).

Other modes include CW, Slow Scan TV, HF AM, PSK31, RTTY, WSPR, JT65, and many many more.

## Station

So you've gotten some operating experience at UCARC and decided that you love HF? Now you probably want to build your own station.

An HF station has some or all of the following components:
* Transceiver
* Amplifier (optional)
* Tuner (optional, but recommended)
* Antenna
* Power Supply

### Transceiver
This is the part of your station with which you will spend the most time. Prices can range from $300 and up. I'd suggest searching hamfests and the sites [QTH](http://swap.qth.com/) and [QRZ](http://forums.qrz.com/forumdisplay.php?3-Online-Swapmeet). The most important things to consider around a transceiver are: (in no particular order)
* Output power
* Covered bands
* Modes of operation
* Receive Filtering
* Receiver coverage
* Usability
* Reliability (google the radio, often times there is a yahoo group centered around a particular model)


### Amplifier
Your first station probably doesn't need one of these.

### Tuner
Because your antenna(s) probably will not be perfectly resonant, you will need an antenna tuner to correct for this. There are two options:
* Manual tuner: e.g. MFJ 941e/949e/969, Johnson Matchbox etc...
* Autotuner: e.g. LDG Z-100 Plus

### Antenna
The antenna is arguably the most important part of your station. TODO: Antenna details. 

### Power Supply
There are basically three choices for a power supply:
* Linear power supply: These are simple, quieter, relatively expensive, and heavy.
* Switching power supply: These are more complicated, can emit some RF noise, much lighter, and often a bit cheaper than linears.
* Battery: In this case, you'd buy a small motorcycle battery or similar and run it with a small power supply, potentially a cheap switch mode, PC power supply, or even a little 2 amp brick. If you keep your transmitting duty cycle down, the battery will basically act like a large capacitor and can be trickle charged.
